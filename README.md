Student Conduct and Discpline System

The Student Conduct and Discipline System (SCDS) is a technology platform at Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Quezon City Branch designed to streamline incident reporting, tracking, and resolution within the university's Student Code and Conduct. Through this online system, students and faculty can formally report violations to the Office of Student Affairs and Services (OSAS). The system autonomously notifies implicated students, assigns offense levels based on the severity of violations, and allows OSAS administrators to resolve cases promptly or escalate them for further investigation.

The scope of SCDS is limited to incidents within the university campus, and it seamlessly integrates with the Student Performance System and Faculty Information System. This integration ensures access to comprehensive databases for efficient incident management. The system aims to centralize and enhance efficiency through modern technology, promoting a positive campus culture. Key benefits include streamlined incident management, centralized data and analytics, transparent communication, fair and consistent enforcement, accessible reporting, automated notifications, and data-driven decision-making.
